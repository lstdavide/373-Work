# Implementation Explanation Document

## Student Information
- Full Name: [Davide Mateas]
- Course Name: [373 04 40994]
- Course Description: [This course explores advanced data structures in C++ with 
a focus on fundamental concepts including pointers, arrays, abstract data types,
and complexity analysis.]
- Assignment Title: [Simple Calculator Application]
- Date: [02/07/2025]

## 1. Introduction
[I built a simple calculator that generates two different random integers and does addition, subtraction, division and multiplication for 10 iterations.]

## 2. Tools and Technologies Used
[I used C++ in cpp.sh to write code, and tested in Visual studio code for correct output.]

- Tool 1: [C++]
- Tool 2: [Visual Studio Code]
- Tool 3: [cpp.sh]

## 3. Implementation Details
### Key Components
- Classes (if used): [class Integer is used to provide an integer and it sets the rule for generation and calculation]
- Functions (if used): [srand. to randomize]
- Algorithms (if used): [for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        int num1 = rand() % 10 + 1;
        int num2 = rand() % 10 + 1;]

### Design Choices
[I tried making the code as readable as possible and left a very aired out code to be easy to read and understand]

## 4. Challenges, Solutions, and Error Report
### Technical Challenges
- Challenge 1: [I had a tough time implementing Integer.h]
  - Solution: [I have read the professor's material to review the Classes subject]

### Error Report
- Common Errors Encountered:
  - Error 1: [couldnt get the randomizer to work and i had syntax error]
    - Cause: [added srand in the wrong place in code hierarchy]
    - Solution: [put it under main and is correct]

## 5. Testing Strategy
### Verification Methods
[I have used Visual Studio Code to simulate the code]

## 6. Conclusion
[I found it challenging but i have followed the guide step by step and it was getting easier]
